Hello, the basic functionality is there and should work, but a lot of validation is missing and I didn't get a chance to properly style the UI. I work fulltime as a student teacher (practicals) and only started working on it on the 20th but my 14 days runs out in about 2 hours from now. So please review, and let me know if it's enough or if you are giving me time to finish up.

It was also my first time using Express/Node, I'm mostly a Python developer (and professionally, I used PHP in almost all my previous jobs, working on mantainance issues/fixing bugs), but express was easy to pick, so I wouldn't have done it any quicker even if I used Python. But I did waste some time trying to learn React before deciding to switch to pure JavaScript.
